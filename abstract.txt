Metamath is a computer language and an associated computer program
for archiving, verifying, and studying mathematical proofs.
The Metamath language is simple and robust, with an
almost total absence of hard-wired syntax, and we believe that it
provides about the simplest possible framework that allows essentially all of
mathematics to be expressed with absolute rigor.
While simple, it is also powerful;
the Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE) database has over 20,000 proven theorems
and is one of the top systems in the “Formalizing 100 Theorems” challenge.
This book explains the Metamath language and program, with specific
emphasis on the fundamentals of the MPE database.
