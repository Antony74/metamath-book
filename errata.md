# Errata

The following are errata for the Metamath 2019 ("Second Edition") book
dated 2019-06-02:

* Section 1.4.2 (page 32, paragraph 3) -
  there's an extraneous ")" after the term set.mm.
* Section 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 headings (page 71) - the headings go past
  the intended margin (though they're quite readable).
* Section 3.9.3 (page 97) - "appraoch" should be "approach".
* Section 4.3 (page 138) - there is a superfluous comma:
  "... option to hide, them, but today ...".
* Section 5.6.3 `set empty_substitution` Command (page 171) -
  there's a duplication and the first bracketed text could be removed.
  It says:
  "(An example where this must be on would
  be a system that implements a Deduction Rule and in which deductions from
  empty assumption lists would be permissible. The MIU-system described in
  Appendix D is another example.) Note that empty substitutions are always
  permissible in proof verification (VERIFY PROOF...) outside the Proof
  Assistant. (See the MIU system in the Metamath book for an example of
  a system needing empty substitutions; another example would be a system
  that implements a Deduction Rule and in which deductions from empty
  assumption lists would be permissible.)"
